Shell scripts
=================

Autolab can also be used directly from a **Windows** or **Linux** terminal to perform a quick single-shot operation without opening explicitely a Python shell. This can be done through 3 different shell scripts:

* **autolab**: to launch the GUI, open the documentation or make a report.
* **autolab-drivers**: terminal shortcut of the :ref:`lowlevel`.
* **autolab-drivers**: terminal shortcut of the :ref:`highlevel`.
