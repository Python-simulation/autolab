=====

This Python package has been created in 2019 by `Quentin Chateiller <https://www.linkedin.com/in/quentinchateiller/>`_ (PhD student) and Bruno Garbin (post-doc researcher) from the `ToniQ team <https://toniq.c2n.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/>`_ of the `C2N-CNRS laboratory <https://www.c2n.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/>`_ (Center for Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies, Palaiseau, France).

The first developpements of the core, the GUI, and the drivers started initially in 2017 by Quentin. Bruno arrived in the team in 2019, providing a new set of Python drivers from its previous laboratory. In order to propose a Python alternative for the automation of scientific experiments in our research team, we finally merged our works in a Python package based on a standardized and robust driver architecture, that makes drivers easy to use and to write by the community.

Thanks to Maxime, Giuseppe and Guilhem for their contributions.
