In the Monitoring window, you can set the **Window length** in seconds. Any points older than this value is removed. You can also set a **Delay** in seconds, which corresponds to a sleep delay between each measure.

You can pause the monitoring with the **Pause** button, and save the current graph and data with the **Save** button. You will be prompted to give a folder path where the data will be saved.
