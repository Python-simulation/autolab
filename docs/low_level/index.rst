Low-level interface (Drivers)
==============================

In Autolab, a Driver is a Python class dedicated to communicate with one particular instrument. This class contains functions that perform particular operations, and may also contain subclasses in case some modules or channels are present in the instrument. Autolab comes with a set of more than 40 different drivers, which are ready to use. 

The first part of this section explains how to configure and open a Driver, and how to use it to communicate with your instrument. Then, we explains how to save locally the configuration of Driver to simplify its further use. Finally, we present the guidelines to use for the creation of new Driver files, to contribute to the Autolab Python package.
